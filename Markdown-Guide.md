# Markdown Guide

[Markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown) is an easy to use markup language based on simple plain text formatting which can be rendered into HTML for viewing or PDF for distribution.

## GitHub Markdown
GitHub's web interface renders Markdown documents natively making it the first choice for documentation when using GitHub.  There's even a built-in editor for creating and editing Markdown documents right on the web interface.

To begin learning the Markdown syntax, here are some useful resources:

* [GitHub Quick Reference](https://help.github.com/articles/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax/)
* [GitHub Markdown Guide](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/)
* [Interactive Markdown Tutorial](http://www.markdowntutorial.com)

:information_source: When browsing through GitHub repositories, any file with the **.md** extension is a Markdown file.

## Markdown Editors
There are a number of Markdown editors available for Window, macOS, and Linux.  Although, some editors may use their own variations of the Markdown syntax not supported by GitHub so the rendering could be different.

###Windows

* [MarkdownPad](http://markdownpad.com)

###Linux

* [Emacs](http://jblevins.org/projects/markdown-mode/)

###macOS

* [MacDown](http://macdown.uranusjr.com)
* [Marked 2](http://marked2app.com/)/[Vim](http://www.vim.org/)

## Markdown Deployment
Markdown can be converted to either HTML or PDF for easier deployment.

Here's a list of conversion options:

* gitprint.com can convert text only Markdown document from public repos
* MacDown has export for both HTML and PDF
* Render with [grip](https://github.com/joeyespo/grip) and export using a web browser
* Command-line conversion with [markdown-pdf](https://github.com/alanshaw/markdown-pdf) (enables automatic conversion via scripts)
