# Starting Guide to [GitHub](https://github.com)
## Introduction
As a collaboration tool, GitHub allows viewing project code and documentation quickly from a web browser but at some point you'll want to pull the codebase somewhere you can actually work on it.  This guide will help you get your development machine ready to start coding.

## Version Control Basics
We'll be using GitHub for all class projects.  GitHub is a hosting service for Git repositories which provides both direct Git access (via ssh or https) and a very useful web front-end. There are many online resources for both Git and GitHub, a few of which we'll list here.

If you've never used a version control system before, start here with this guide...

If you've used a VCS before but not git, skip to here in the guide to get an overview of git...

As a student, you should consider using GitHub (or a similar service) not only for this class but for all of your classes.  At minimum, it provides a remote backup of all your work in case of a catastrophic event but there are many other benefits:

* Storing class work in a repository organizes everything into a centralized location
* Retain the history of all your files in case you change something you needed
* Save scanned handouts, tests, notes, etc to have a paperless archive
* Access your work from any computer
* Gain a valuable skill in many fields to list on your résumé

GitHub's [Student Developer Pack](https://education.github.com/pack) offers unlimited private repositories and many other tools free for students.

## Setting Up Your Machine
To get started you'll need to configure your machine to use Git.  The setup varies depending on the operating system and each OS has a number of options.

### Windows/OSX
[GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com) is available for Windows and Mac and provides both a GUI and command-line tools.  This will be the recommended option for this class but feel free to use any other tools available.  Some options are 
[GitKraken](https://www.gitkraken.com),
[SourceTree](https://www.atlassian.com/software/sourcetree) and
[TortoiseGit](https://tortoisegit.org).

### Linux
All the major linux distributions have a git package that can be installed easily.  For Debian-based distros (e.g. Ubuntu):

```shell
$ sudo apt-get install git-all
```

### TODO: Local Settings (username, ssh-key, etc...)

:warning: **Warning:** Beware setting up an ssh-key on a public machine.


## GitHub Account Setup

Follow this guide to setup your GitHub account: [GitHub Account Setup](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/GitHub-Account-Setup-and-Configuration)

Once your personal account is setup:

1. Run thought the [hello-world](https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/) tutorial to learn how GitHub works 
1. Optionally signup for GitHub's [Student Developer Pack](https://education.github.com/pack) (although it's not required for this course)
1. Send your username to the instructor so you can be added to the class team
1. Add an ssh-key to your account


## GitHub Desktop

GitHub Desktop provides both GUI and CLI tools to manage your GitHub repositories locally on your development machine.

There's a tutorial when you first run GitHub Desktop to highlight the various functions of the GUI.
